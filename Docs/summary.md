# Project Summary

## Overview

This project is a **Next.js portfolio** showcasing interactive web demos built with **React** and **Three.js**. The portfolio features a collection of creative, real-time 3D and audio visualizations, each accessible from a central landing page. The project demonstrates skills in modern frontend development, 3D graphics, and interactive UI design.

## Features

- **Rotating 3D Cube Demo**
  An interactive 3D object that users can rotate and transform into different shapes (cube, sphere, cone, cylinder, torus, tetrahedron) using mouse or touch input. Clicking the object cycles through the shapes.

- **Particle Mouse Effect Demo**
  A real-time particle system where 3D particles follow the user's mouse movements, creating a dynamic and visually engaging effect.

- **3D Landscape with Trees Demo**
  A procedurally generated 3D landscape featuring trees and rocks. Users can interact with the scene by clicking on trees to "collect wood," which updates a score counter. The scene includes basic camera controls for navigation.

- **Audio Analyzer Demo**
  An audio analysis tool that allows users to upload an audio file. The app analyzes the file's properties (duration, sample rate, channels, dynamic range, etc.), provides feedback and suggestions for improvement, and visualizes the waveform.

- **3D Model with Interactive Hotspots**
  An experimental demo built with React Three Fiber featuring a procedural 3D futuristic building with interactive hotspots. Users can hover over glowing spheres to see information tooltips and click to select hotspots. The scene includes orbit controls for camera movement, professional lighting, and animated elements.

## User Experience Features

- **Consistent Navigation**: All demo pages include a "Back to Home" button for seamless navigation between demos
- **Responsive Design**: All demos are optimized for both desktop and mobile interactions
- **Interactive UI**: Hover effects, tooltips, and visual feedback enhance user engagement
- **Performance Optimized**: Efficient 3D rendering and cleanup for smooth performance across devices

## Technologies Used

- **Next.js** (React framework for server-side rendering and routing)
- **React** (UI library)
- **Three.js** (3D graphics and visualization)
- **React Three Fiber** (@react-three/fiber for declarative 3D scenes)
- **React Three Drei** (@react-three/drei for 3D utilities and helpers)
- **Tailwind CSS** (for styling and responsive design)
- **TypeScript** (type safety and modern JavaScript features)

## Purpose

The portfolio serves as a demonstration of the developer's ability to create interactive, visually rich web applications using modern JavaScript frameworks and 3D graphics libraries. Each demo highlights a different aspect of frontend and creative coding expertise.
